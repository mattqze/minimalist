    <h2>Do you like being bored?</h2>
    <p>You must, considering you clicked on this website. Y'know, being bored is the state of being open to anything. This screaming white page is actually a wake-up call to your mind to start doing something because it sucks to read this website.</p>
    <h2>Why be bored?</h2>
    <p>What exactly is keeping you hooked, making you read this website: it's bizzare. Your brain is panicking due to the lack of banner and footer ads and no dark mode.</p>
    <h2>Let's get it out, the 'm i n i m a l i s t i c' bullshit is awful.</h2>
    <p>Websites should grab your attention and hold onto it for as long as possible. You're an ape who suddenly learned how to operate a computer, your attention is out of wack. Now, I'm not saying websites should look like <a href="awful-but-awful.png">this</a>, however, they should not be bland as to have people read them. Personally, I make a balance between 'boring as shit' and 'wow fancy'. Take <a href="https://me.tunnull.xyz">my website</a> as an example. I'm no <a href="https://stallman.org">RMS</a>, but I make do with my 'skills'.</p>
    <h2>'But, *INSERT CORPORATE NAME HERE* needs mongey for websoot!'</h2>
    <p>Okay?.. I paid $2.13 for the tunnull.xyz domain name. I host my own websites, or use github pages and, regretably, use cloudflare for DNS. I pay for nothing besides the domain. The 'X person/people need money to run it' claim is bullshit. If they cared in what they do, they wouldn't charge anything. The internet should be free to use. Your rampant cockblocking due to greed should be called out rather than defended by people you don't know.</p>
